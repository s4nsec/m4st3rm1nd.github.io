I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Central Florida](https://ucf.edu) advised by [Paul Gazzillo](https://paulgazzillo.com/).
I am broadly interested in computer systems security, fuzzing, and vulnerability research. My research is on configuration-aware Linux kernel fuzzing.
You can reach me at ``` sanan.hasanov [at] ucf [dot] edu```.
